Originally written for use on a Raspberry Pi Model 3b with the display connected over I2C, running the Allstarlink software. As the display is accessed using the ~luma.oled~, this could be changed to another display type. The ~pygame~ device is useful for local testing.

This all ended up in a box with the Pi, a speaker, and an interface to the radio mic:

** Hardware Setup
The SSD1306 module has 4 pins labelled GND, VCC, SCL, SDA. Each of these should be connected directly to a pin on the Pi's GPIO header.

See [[https://pinout.xyz/][pinout.xyx]] for the exact numbering scheme and exact locations of pins. Connections should be made as follows:

|---------+--------------------------------------------------|
| SSD1306 | Raspberry Pi                                     |
|---------+--------------------------------------------------|
| GND     | Any ground pin (6, 9, 14, 20, 25, 30, 34, or 39) |
| VCC     | Any 5v pin (2 or 4)                              |
| SCL     | Pin 5 - GPIO 3 / I2C1 SCL                        |
| SDA     | Pin 3 - GPIO 2 / I2C1 SDA                        |
|---------+--------------------------------------------------|

Finally, enable I2C on the Raspberry Pi with ~sudo raspi-config~ then navigate to "3 Interface Options" => "P5 I2C" => "Yes" to enable ARM I2C interface.

** Software Setup
First install some dependencies. This command will work with Debian 12 (ASL3), you may need to do something different for other distributions:

#+BEGIN_SRC
sudo apt-get install -y make python3-pip xfonts-terminus fonts-dejavu libopenjp2-7 libsdl2-dev
#+END_SRC

Download the repository and enter its directory:
#+BEGIN_SRC
git clone https://github.com/mattmelling/radioless-oled-display.git
cd radioless-oled-display
#+END_SRC

Then to install:
#+BEGIN_SRC
sudo make install
sudo systemctl edit radioless-oled-display.service
#+END_SRC

In the editor window, set the following environment variables:

#+BEGIN_SRC
[Service]
Environment=LUMA_DEVICE="pygame" or "ssd1306"
Environment=ASTERISK_PASSWORD="asterisk manager password"
Environment=ASL_CALLSIGN="node callsign"
Environment=ASL_NODE="node number"
#+END_SRC

The above assumes that asterisk is running on the same device, if that is not the case you may need to set the following depending on your specific configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC
Environment=ASTERISK_HOSTNAME="localhost"
Environment=ASTERISK_PORT="5038"
Environment=ASTERISK_USERNAME="admin"
#+END_SRC

Then

#+BEGIN_SRC
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart radioless-oled-display.service
#+END_SRC

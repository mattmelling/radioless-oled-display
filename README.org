Originally written for use on a Raspberry Pi Model 3b with the display connected over I2C, running the Allstarlink software. As the display is accessed using the ~luma.oled~, this could be changed to another display type. The ~pygame~ device is useful for local testing.

This all ended up in a box with the Pi, a speaker, and an interface to the radio mic:
